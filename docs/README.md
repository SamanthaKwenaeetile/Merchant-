## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Overall design philosophy is influence mainly by the user and client stories and by the fact that
the hotel is aimed at the high-end market, ideally customers are more influenced by the uniqueness of the experience rather than the cost. 
Hence the choice of colour scheme, layout, and typography.
